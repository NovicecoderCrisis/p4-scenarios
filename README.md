You will find in this repository a set of P4 scenarios organized in Jupyter notebooks.   

Scenarios currently available include:    

- firewall

### Requirements
- Jupyter notebook
- Mininet-WiFi
    - If you already have Mininet-WiFi you need to install P4 dependencies with `sudo util/install.sh -P`.
      - **Note**: As P4 requires many dependencies, if you face problems during the installation you will need to resolve them by yourself. You may want to refer to [https://github.com/jafingerhut/p4-guide](https://github.com/jafingerhut/p4-guide) too.
